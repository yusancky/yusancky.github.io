On October 16th, 2022, I set up my own blog - "**Yusancky's Note**", with the original intention of recording and sharing the beauty of life, as well as discovering and exchanging technical knowledge.

Yusancky's Note uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the theme [MemE](https://github.com/reuixiy/hugo-theme-meme), hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and deployed by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). The site uses [Merriweather](https://github.com/SorkinType/Merriweather) to show most of the words, and uses [Inconsolata](https://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) as the font of the code. About half a month after the Yusancky's Note officially being put online, the comment feature is also live thanks to [utterances](https://utteranc.es/). Heartfelt thanks to all contributors of these projects!

I'll be updating the website with more content in the future, so stay tuned!
